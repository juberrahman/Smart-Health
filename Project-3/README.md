<b>Instructions</b></br>

* Select a 12 lead ECG database (e.g. St. Petersburg INCART Database) from Physionet and read the dataset descriptions to identify the heart patient types (e.g MI, CAD, TIA, Other)</br>
* load and process the dataset using python WFDB, neurokit, biosppy etc. packages </br>
* read about the different ECG channels and pick the best channel signal e.g. V2, V5 etc. </br>
* Develop an articial neural network for multi-category heart disease classification from single channel ECG </br>
* Develop a 1-D convolutional neural network model for multi-category heart disease classification from single channel ECG </br>
* Compare the performances of the developed deep learning models </br> 
* Upload/Pull request your notebook on Smart Health course Github Project-2 branch </br>
